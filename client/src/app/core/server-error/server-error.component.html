    <p>What to do next?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open chrome dev tools</li>
      <li>Inspect the network tab</li>
      <li>Check the failing request</li>
      <li>Examine this request URL - make sure this is correct</li>
      <li>Reproduce the error in postman - if we the same reponse in Postman, then the issue is NOT with Angular</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Following is the stack trace - this is where your investigation should start!</p>
